It handles pooling these sessions for reuse in subsequent operations.\n * - **Cursor Operations**: A MongoClient's cursors use the health monitoring system to send the request for more documents to the same server the query began on.\n * - **Mongocryptd process**: When using auto encryption, a MongoClient will launch a `mongocryptd` instance for handling encryption if the mongocrypt shared library isn't in use.\n *\n * There are many more features of a MongoClient that are not listed above.\n *\n * In order to enable these features, a number of asynchronous Node.js resources are established by the driver: Timers, FS Requests, Sockets, etc.\n * For details on cleanup, please refer to the MongoClient `close()` documentation.\n *\n * @example\n * ```ts\n * import { MongoClient } from 'mongodb';\n * // Enable command monitoring for debugging\n * const client = new MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017?appName=mflix', { monitorCommands: true });\n * ```\n */\nclass MongoClient extends mongo_types_1.TypedEventEmitter {\n  constructor(url, options) {\n    super();\n    this.driverInfoList = [];\n    this.on('error', utils_1.noop);\n    this.options = (0, connection_string_1.parseOptions)(url, this, options);\n    this.appendMetadata(this.options.driverInfo);\n    const shouldSetLogger = Object.values(this.options.mongoLoggerOptions.componentSeverities).some(value => value !== mongo_logger_1.SeverityLevel.OFF);\n    this.mongoLogger = shouldSetLogger ? new mongo_logger_1.MongoLogger(this.options.mongoLoggerOptions) : undefined;\n    // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-this-alias\n    const client = this;\n    // The internal state\n    this.s = {\n      url,\n      bsonOptions: (0, bson_1.resolveBSONOptions)(this.options),\n      namespace: (0, utils_1.ns)('admin'),\n      hasBeenClosed: false,\n      sessionPool: new sessions_1.ServerSessionPool(this),\n      activeSessions: new Set(),\n      activeCursors: new Set(),\n      authProviders: new mongo_client_auth_providers_1.MongoClientAuthProviders(),\n      get options() {\n        return client.options;\n      },\n      get readConcern() {\n        return client.options.readConcern;\n      },\n      get writeConcern() {\n        return client.options.writeConcern;\n      },\n      get readPreference() {\n        return client.options.readPreference;\n      },\n      get isMongoClient() {\n        return true;\n      }\n    };\n    this.checkForNonGenuineHosts();\n  }\n  /**\n   * @experimental\n   * An alias for {@link MongoClient.close|MongoClient.close()}.\n   */\n  async [Symbol.asyncDispose]() {\n    await this.close();\n  }\n  /**\n   * Append metadata to the client metadata after instantiation.\n   * @param driverInfo -

Client-side:\n   *   - **Close in-use connections**: Any connections that are currently waiting on a response from the server will be closed.\n   *     This is performed _first_ to avoid reaching the next step (server-side clean up) and having no available connections to check out.\n   *     - _Ideal_: All operations have been awaited or cancelled, and the outcomes, regardless of success or failure, have been processed before closing the client servicing the operation.\n   *     - _Pitfall_: When `client.close()` is called and all connections are in use, after closing them, the client must create new connections for cleanup operations, which comes at the cost of new TLS/TCP handshakes and authentication steps.\n   * - Server-side:\n   *   - **Close active cursors**: All cursors that haven't been completed will have a `killCursor` operation sent to the server they were initialized on, freeing the server-side resource.\n   *     - _Ideal_: Cursors are explicitly closed or completed before `client.close()` is called.\n   *     - _Pitfall_: `killCursors` may have to build a new connection if the in-use closure ended all pooled connections.\n   *   - **End active sessions**: In-use sessions created with `client.startSession()` or `client.withSession()` or implicitly by the driver will have their `.endSession()` method called.\n   *     Contrary to the name of the method, `endSession()` returns the session to the client's pool of sessions rather than end them on the server.\n   *     - _Ideal_: Transaction outcomes are awaited and their corresponding explicit sessions are ended before `client.close()` is called.\n   *     - _Pitfall_: **This step aborts in-progress transactions**. It is advisable to observe the outcome of a transaction before closing your client.\n   *   - **End all pooled sessions**: The `endSessions` command with all session IDs the client has pooled is sent to the server to inform the cluster it can clean them up.\n   *     - _Ideal_: No user intervention is expected.\n   *     - _Pitfall_: None.\n   *\n   * The remaining shutdown is of the MongoClient resources that are intended to be entirely internal but is documented here as their existence relates to the JS event loop.\n   *\n   * - Client-side (again):\n   *   - **Stop all server monitoring**: Connections kept live for detecting cluster changes and roundtrip time measurements are shutdown.\n   *   - **Close all pooled connections**: Each server node in the cluster has a corresponding connection pool and all connections in the pool are closed. Any operations waiting to check out a connection will have an error thrown instead of a connection returned.\n   *   - **Clear out server selection queue**: Any operations that are in the process of waiting for a server to be selected will have an error thrown instead of a server returned.\n   *   - **Close encryption-related resources**: An internal MongoClient created for communicating with `mongocryptd` or other encryption purposes is closed. (Using this same method of course!)\n   *\n   * After the close method completes there should be no MongoClient related resources [ref-ed in Node.js' event loop](https://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/handle.html#reference-counting).\n   * This should allow Node.js to exit gracefully if MongoClient resources were the only active handles in the event loop.\n   *\n   * @param _force - currently an unused flag that has no effect.

Client-side:\n   *   - **Close in-use connections**: Any connections that are currently waiting on a response from the server will be closed.\n   *     This is performed _first_ to avoid reaching the next step (server-side clean up) and having no available connections to check out.\n   *     - _Ideal_: All operations have been awaited or cancelled, and the outcomes, regardless of success or failure, have been processed before closing the client servicing the operation.\n   *     - _Pitfall_: When `client.close()` is called and all connections are in use, after closing them, the client must create new connections for cleanup operations, which comes at the cost of new TLS/TCP handshakes and authentication steps.\n   * - Server-side:\n   *   - **Close active cursors**: All cursors that haven't been completed will have a `killCursor` operation sent to the server they were initialized on, freeing the server-side resource.\n   *     - _Ideal_: Cursors are explicitly closed or completed before `client.close()` is called.\n   *     - _Pitfall_: `killCursors` may have to build a new connection if the in-use closure ended all pooled connections.\n   *   - **End active sessions**: In-use sessions created with `client.startSession()` or `client.withSession()` or implicitly by the driver will have their `.endSession()` method called.\n   *     Contrary to the name of the method, `endSession()` returns the session to the client's pool of sessions rather than end them on the server.\n   *     - _Ideal_: Transaction outcomes are awaited and their corresponding explicit sessions are ended before `client.close()` is called.\n   *     - _Pitfall_: **This step aborts in-progress transactions**. It is advisable to observe the outcome of a transaction before closing your client.\n   *   - **End all pooled sessions**: The `endSessions` command with all session IDs the client has pooled is sent to the server to inform the cluster it can clean them up.\n   *     - _Ideal_: No user intervention is expected.\n   *     - _Pitfall_: None.\n   *\n   * The remaining shutdown is of the MongoClient resources that are intended to be entirely internal but is documented here as their existence relates to the JS event loop.\n   *\n   * - Client-side (again):\n   *   - **Stop all server monitoring**: Connections kept live for detecting cluster changes and roundtrip time measurements are shutdown.\n   *   - **Close all pooled connections**: Each server node in the cluster has a corresponding connection pool and all connections in the pool are closed. Any operations waiting to check out a connection will have an error thrown instead of a connection returned.\n   *   - **Clear out server selection queue**: Any operations that are in the process of waiting for a server to be selected will have an error thrown instead of a server returned.\n   *   - **Close encryption-related resources**: An internal MongoClient created for communicating with `mongocryptd` or other encryption purposes is closed. (Using this same method of course!)\n   *\n   * After the close method completes there should be no MongoClient related resources [ref-ed in Node.js' event loop](https://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/handle.html#reference-counting).\n   * This should allow Node.js to exit gracefully if MongoClient resources were the only active handles in the event loop.\n   *\n   * @param _force - currently an unused flag that has no effect.
